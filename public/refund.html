        <h1>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h1>
        <p>At <strong>Gymsewa</strong>, we offer our services on a subscription basis, with payment options available on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly basis. This policy outlines the terms regarding subscription cancellation and refunds.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>1. Subscription Cancellation</h2>
        <p>Once a subscription is initiated, it is considered active and will remain so for the entire duration of the selected period (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users have the option to pause their subscription or raise a request for cancellation, which will be effective from the next billing cycle.</li>
            <li>If a user chooses to pause or cancel a subscription, they must do so before the next billing date to avoid charges for the following subscription period.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>2. Non-Refundable Policy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All subscription fees are non-refundable once payment is successfully processed.</li>
            <li>There will be no refunds or credits for partial subscription periods or unused services during the active subscription.</li>
            <li>In the case of accidental or duplicate payments, please contact our support team immediately at <a href="mailto:support@gymsewa.com">support@gymsewa.com</a>, and we will investigate the issue on a case-by-case basis.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>3. Modification of Subscription Terms</h2>
        <p>Users may modify their subscription plan (e.g., switch from monthly to yearly) at any time. However, any changes will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle, and no prorated refunds will be provided for the current cycle.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>4. Refund Exceptions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Refunds will only be provided in cases of fraud, technical issues preventing access to the service, or billing errors on our part.</li>
            <li>Any other requests will be assessed on a discretionary basis by <strong>BYTEWAVE INNOVATIONS LAB LLP</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>5. Refund Timeline</h2>
        <p>If a refund is approved, the time taken to process the refund will depend on the payment gateway used. Typically, refunds may take <strong>5 to 10 business days</strong> to reflect in the userâ€™s account after approval.</p>
        <p>Users are encouraged to contact their bank or payment provider for any further inquiries regarding the processing time.</p>
